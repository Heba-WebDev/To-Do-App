## About the app


- User can add a todo item to the list
- The user can delete any item from the list
- The user can filter through the items: show the active (uncompleted), the completed or/and all the items
- The user can switch from light mode to dark mode



## What I learned from the project

- Thinking in terms of data and DOM nodes. I mainpluated the data and didn't need the DOM
- Working with states for the first time
- React states are the only source of truth, every changes goes through them
- No changes are made directly to a state 





**This is a coding challenge by Front-end mentor but this is my code 100%!** ðŸš€
